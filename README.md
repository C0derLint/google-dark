# Google Dark Search

This is a userstyle to turn the Google Search website dark, also often described as 'Night Mode'.  

The aim is to be highly customizable and extremely comprehensive.

It is currently in beta, meaning customization has not been throroughly tested yet and some more obscure widgets might not be styled yet. If you notice something along those lines, please open an issue.  

It can be installed with the browser extension [Stylus](https://add0n.com/stylus.html) by clicking [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hyperfekt/google-dark/master/search/search.user.css).  

The mobile site is currently not supported.
